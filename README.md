- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Astro
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Initially, I tried to make more use of components. I aimed to create a navbar that transforms into a hamburger icon on mobile view, ensuring it is accessible. For building a lightbox, I used a dialog element, which is modal and covers the entire screen. There were many aspects in JavaScript that I had to consider to ensure necessary updates. Additionally, for creating a cart where items can be added, I used a non-modal dialog.

One of the key points in this project was to meticulously adhere to accessibility guidelines. I did my best, and if you see any areas for improvement, please let me know. If I were to undertake this project again in the future, I would definitely use a framework.

### Useful resources

- [Dialog vs. Modals vs. Popovers](https://talks.hiddedevries.nl/VZNuWJ/slides) - This helped me for learning more about modals.
